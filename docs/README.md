# chaostoolkit documentation

## Getting Started

This project is based on [MkDocs][], a Python documentation generator based on
[Markdown][].

To get started, install Python 3 on your machine, a [virtual environment][venv]
and install the dependencies using [pip][] as follows:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

[MkDocs]: http://www.mkdocs.org/
[Markdown]: https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax
[venv]: https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/
[pip]: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start a local server to view the
docs:

```
$ mkdocs serve
```
