# Chaos Toolkit - Chaos Engineering for All Engineers

The Chaos Toolkit, or as we love to call it &#x201C;ctk&#x201D;, is a simple
CLI-driven tool that helps you write and run Chaos Engineering experiments. It 
supports any target platform you can think of, through
[existing extensions](https://chaostoolkit.org/drivers/overview/) or
through extensions you write as you need.

Chaos Toolkit is versatile and works really well in settings where other Chaos
Engineering tools may not fit: cloud environments, datacenters, CI/CD, etc.

## Install or Upgrade

Provided you have Python 3.8+ installed, you can install it as follows:

```console
$ pip install -U chaostoolkit
```

## Getting Started

Once you have installed the Chaos Toolkit you can use it through its simple command line tool. 

Running an experiment is as simple as:

```console
$ chaos run experiment.json
```

## Get involved!

Chaos Toolkit's mission is to provide an open API to chaos engineering in all its forms. As such, we encourage and welcome you  to [join][join] our open community Slack team to discuss and share your experiments and needs with the community.
You can also use [StackOverflow][so] to ask any questions regarding using the
Chaos Toolkit or Chaos Engineering.

[so]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=chaostoolkit+chaosengineering

If you'd prefer not to use Slack then we welcome you to raise GitHub issues on this repo, for any questions, requests, or discussions around the Chaos Toolkit.

Finally you can also email `contact@chaostoolkit.org` with any questions you might have.
