# Chaos Toolkit Code Of Conduct

Chaos Toolkit adopts Debian project's Code Of Conduct for its
participants and contributors.

## Be respectful

In the Chaos Toolkit project, inevitably there will be people with whom you
may disagree, or find it difficult to cooperate. Accept that, but even
so, remain respectful. Disagreement is no excuse for poor behaviour or
personal attacks, and a community in which people feel threatened is
not a healthy community.

## Assume good faith

Chaos Toolkit contributors have many ways of reaching our common goal
of an open API for Chaos Engineering which may differ from your
ways. Assume that other people are working towards this goal.

Note that many of our Contributors are from around the globe, not
native English speakers and may have different cultural backgrounds.

## Be Collaborative

Chaos Toolkit is a large project; there is always more to learn within
it. It's good to ask for help when you need it. Similarly, offers for
help should be seen in the context of our shared goal of improving
Chaos Toolkit.

When you make something for the benefit of the project, be willing to
explain to others how it works, so that they can build on your work to
make it even better.

## Try to be concise

Keep in mind that what you write once will be read by hundreds of
people. Writing a short email means people can understand the
conversation as efficiently as possible. When a long explanation is
necessary, consider adding a summary.

Try to bring new arguments to a conversation so that each mail adds
something unique to the thread, keeping in mind that the rest of the
thread still contains the other messages with arguments that have
already been made.

Try to stay on topic, especially in discussions that are already fairly large.

## Be open

Most ways of communication used within Chaos Toolkit allow for public
and private communication. You should use public methods of
communication for Chaos Toolkit related messages, unless posting
something sensitive.

## In case of problems

While this code of conduct should be adhered to by participants, we
recognize that sometimes people may have a bad day, or be unaware of
some of the guidelines in this code of conduct. When that happens, you
may reply to them and point out this code of conduct. Instances of
otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting team at
contact@chaostoolkit.org. All complaints will be reviewed and
investigated and will result in a response that is appropriate to the
circumstances.
