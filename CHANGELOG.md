## [1.4.0][] - 2020-02-20

* Replaced pkg_resource usage with python 3.8 backport importlib_metadata
* Bump chaostoolkit-lib dependency to 1.8.0

## [1.3.0][] - 2019-09-03

[1.3.0]: https://github.com/chaostoolkit/chaostoolkit/compare/1.2.0...1.3.0

### Added

- Load global controls before we even read the experiments so we can apply
  them before and after loading the experiment.

## [1.2.0][] - 2018-04-17

[1.2.0]: https://github.com/chaostoolkit/chaostoolkit/compare/1.1.0...1.2.0

### Added

- Support for structured logging [#122][122]

[122]: https://github.com/chaostoolkit/chaostoolkit/issues/122

### Changed

- Moved loading global controls back into `run_experiment` itself
  [chaostoolkit-lib#116][116]

[116]: https://github.com/chaostoolkit/chaostoolkit-lib/issues/116

## [1.1.0][] - 2018-04-17

[1.1.0]: https://github.com/chaostoolkit/chaostoolkit/compare/1.0.0...1.1.0

## Added

- Bump to Chaos Toolkit library 1.2.0
- Allow to declare and load controls from settings so they are globally
  applied to all your runs [chaostoolkit-lib#99][99]

  In your settings file, at `~/.chaostooltkit-lib/settings.yaml` add, for
  instance:

  ```yaml
  controls:
  my-own-control:
    provider:
      module: mypackage.mycontrole_module
      type: python
  ```

  This will load `mypackage/mycontrole_module.py` from your `PYTHONPATH`
  and use it as a [control][].
- Remove MacOSX build. Way too long for any benefits.
- Build against stable Python 3.7
- Ensure exit code is set in all cases

[1.0.0rc1]: https://github.com/chaostoolkit/chaostoolkit/compare/0.17.1...1.0.0rc1

## Changed

- Pin dependency versions

## [0.17.1][] - 2018-11-30

[0.17.1]: https://github.com/chaostoolkit/chaostoolkit/compare/0.17.0...0.17.1

### Changed

* Remove `NoReturn` import as it is not available prior Python 3.6.5 [#90][90]

[90]: https://github.com/chaostoolkit/chaostoolkit/issues/90

## [0.17.0][] - 2018-11-29

[0.17.0]: https://github.com/chaostoolkit/chaostoolkit/compare/0.16.0...0.17.0

### Added

- add `info` command to display basic information such as version of the
  toolkit core library or installed extensions. Display also the current
  settings [#64][64]

[64]: https://github.com/chaostoolkit/chaostoolkit/issues/64

### Changed

- strip command name before sending it to check newer version as sometimes
  we get a tabulation character in there
- swap `logger.warn` for `logger.warning` as the former is obsolete

## [0.16.0][] - 2018-09-19

[0.16.0]: https://github.com/chaostoolkit/chaostoolkit/compare/0.15.0...0.16.0

### Added

- send a `RunFlowEvent.RunDeviated` event in addition to other events when the
  steady state deviated after the experimental method [#56][56]

[56]: https://github.com/chaostoolkit/chaostoolkit/issues/56

## [0.15.0][] - 2018-08-09

[0.15.0]: https://github.com/chaostoolkit/chaostoolkit/compare/0.14.0...0.15.0

## Added

- a new global flag `chaos --settings <path>` to explicitely specify the
  location of the Chaos Toolkit settings file
- experiments can now also be loaded from a HTTP(s) resource (with or without
  auth) as per [#53][53]

[53]: https://github.com/chaostoolkit/chaostoolkit/issues/53

## Changed

- by default, the run command will now set the exit code to 1 when the
  experiment is not successful (interrupted, aborted or failed). This can be
  bypassed by plugins so they have the opportunity to process the journal as
  well. In that case, they must set the exit code themselves to play nicely.

## [0.14.0][] - 2018-04-27

[0.14.0]: https://github.com/chaostoolkit/chaostoolkit/compare/0.13.0...0.14.0

- Name of the journal output from the run command is now `journal.json` rather
  than `chaos-report.json` [#31][31]

- You can bypass argument in the init command via empty string [#29][29]
- Allow to create steady-state hypothesis from init command [#28][28]
